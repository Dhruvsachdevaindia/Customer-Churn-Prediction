# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Forecasting Customer Attrition in a Telecommunications Firm Goal
This project's main goal is to create a predictive model that can detect clients who are likely to leave. The telecom provider can take proactive steps to keep at-risk consumers and improve overall customer satisfaction and profitability by accurately forecasting churn.

Gathering and Preparing the Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset, the dataset used for this project, is available on Kaggle. This dataset comprises subscribed services, account details, and customer demographics.
Preparing Data
A vital step in making sure the dataset is clean and appropriate for analysis is data preprocessing. Among the preprocessing actions are:

Managing Value Missing:

Determine and examine the dataset's missing values.
For numerical variables, use suitable imputation techniques like mean, median, or mode imputation; for categorical variables, use the most frequent value or a new category.
Categorical Variable Encoding:

Transform categorical variables into numerical format by applying methods such as label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Before using any categorical features in machine learning algorithms, make sure they are all appropriately encoded.
Normalization and Scaling:

Apply scaling techniques such as standardization or normalization to numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale.
This step ensures that features with larger magnitudes do not dominate the model training process.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand customer behavior and the factors influencing churn. Key steps in EDA include:

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics for numerical features (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
Assess the distribution of categorical variables.
Visualizations:

Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
Use histograms, bar plots, and box plots to analyze numerical and categorical variables.
Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify correlations between features.
Generate visualizations such as scatter plots, pair plots, and violin plots to explore relationships between features and the target variable (churn).
Churn Analysis:

Analyze the proportion of churned vs. non-churned customers.
Visualize the impact of various features on churn using plots like bar charts, stacked bar charts, and pie charts.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Key steps include:

Creating New Features:

Derive new features from existing ones, such as tenure groups, total charges per month, and interaction terms.
Create binary flags for important categorical features.
Feature Selection:

Use techniques like feature importance from tree-based models, correlation analysis, and mutual information to select relevant features.
Remove redundant or irrelevant features to reduce noise and improve model performance.
Building the Churn Prediction Model
Several machine learning algorithms can be used for churn prediction. The selected algorithms for this project are:

Logistic Regression:

A simple and interpretable model that provides a baseline for comparison.
Suitable for binary classification problems like churn prediction.
Random Forest:

An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control over-fitting.
Provides feature importance, which is useful for feature selection.
Gradient Boosting:

An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct the errors of previous models.
Highly effective for complex datasets and provides robust performance.
Model Training and Tuning
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train each model using the training set.
Use techniques like cross-validation and grid search to fine-tune hyperparameters for each model.
Ensure models are not overfitting by validating performance on the testing set.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the churn prediction models using the following metrics:

Accuracy:

Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples.
Precision:

Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
Recall:

Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives).
F1-Score:

The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate the model.
F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).
Confusion Matrix:

A matrix that provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
ROC-AUC Curve:

Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
AUC (Area Under the Curve) provides a single metric for model evaluation.
